# SmartCpp
### Introduction

This project is for learning C++. If you have the basic knowledge of C++, then there is nothing valuable here.

You may have found that most of the content of this project is illustrated in the book "C++ primer". BingGo! I am reading this book now and it will last a long time. After I finish reading this book, I will try to clear up all the codes and texts into some topics and add something else. Whatever, I will keep maintaining this project as long as I am still learning or using C++.

For now, I am trying to add more useful things into this project, though it seems a mess.
