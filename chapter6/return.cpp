     * Functions with No Return Value
     *
     * A function with a void return type may return the result of calling another function
     * that returns void. Returning any other expression from a void function is a compile-time
     * error.
     * 
     * Failing to provide a return after a loop that contains a return is an error. However,
     * many compilers will not detect such errors.
     * 
     * 
     * How Values Are Returned
     * 
     * It is important to keep in mind the initialization rules in functions that return local variables.
     * The copy of local variables will be returned.
     * 
     * 
     * Never Return a Reference or Pointer to a Local Object
     * 
     * 
     * Functions That Return Class Tyoes and the Call Operator
